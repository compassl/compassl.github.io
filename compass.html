                    The compass, also called a magnetic compass, is an object used for geographic orientation.
                    <p>For a long time this instrument was used in navigation as a way of locating, and until today it is considered one of the greatest inventions of humanity.</p>

                <div id="description">
                    The compass was probably created in China in the 1st century. Unlike what we know today, at that time the compass prototype was created with a square plate that represented the Earth. Under it was placed a kind of magnetite spoon. Early on, this object was used in navigation and until the present day it has great importance in the studies of cartography and astronomy. Later it was brought to Europe by the Arabs and taken to other parts of the world.
                    <p>Already in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance it was a very well-known instrument. It was it that allowed and facilitated the exploration of the new world at the time of the great navigations. In the 13th century, the Italian navigator and inventor Flavio Gioia contributed to the improvement of the compass. He used this system under a card with a compass rose, which indicated the cardinal points. For some people, he is seen as the inventor of the object.</p>
                    <p>However, it was only in the 19th century that the modern compass was developed. That's because the English inventor and physicist William Sturgeon built the first electromagnet in 1825.</p>
                    <p>From this, several types of compass were created. With the current and technological advances it is possible today to have an online compass.</p>
                    <p>That is, through an application installed on a device (cell phone, tablet, computer) the digital compass can be used by anyone who wants to locate themselves.</p>

                    <p>üî∏ How it works</p>
                </div>

                <div id="description">
                    By means of a magnetized needle placed horizontally, the compass is an object capable of locating the cardinal points (north, south, east and west) and subcollaterals of the Earth. That's because it acts under the terrestrial magnetism, being attracted to the direction of the planet's poles.
                    <p>The needle, suspended by the center of gravity, rotates according to the movements performed. Note that it always points towards the Earth's magnetic north pole. That's because the planet works like a huge magnet that exerts a force of attraction in that direction.</p>

                    The term compass comes from Italian and means ‚Äúsmall box‚Äù.
                    <p>Metal objects and electrical circuits can interfere with the compass.</p>
                    <p>Compasses are protected by glass covers to prevent interference from other metals.</p>
                    <p>The geographic pole is different from the Earth's magnetic pole. It is located about 1,930 km north of the magnetic pole.</p>
                    <p>Magnetic declination represents an angle formed between magnetic and geographic north. The Bermuda Triangle is a place on the globe where magnetic declination occurs.</p>
